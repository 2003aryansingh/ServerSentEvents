# Server-Sent Events (SSE) Example

This repository contains an example implementation of Server-Sent Events (SSE) in a web application.

## Description

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a simple and efficient protocol for real-time communication between a server and a client over a single HTTP connection. SSE allows the server to send event updates to the client as text or JSON-encoded data, which can be processed in real-time by the client using JavaScript.

This example demonstrates a very raw representation of how ServerSentEvents work

## Features

- Establishes a SSE connection between the server and the client using the `EventSource` API in JavaScript.
- Sends SSE events from the server to the client with updated data in real-time.
